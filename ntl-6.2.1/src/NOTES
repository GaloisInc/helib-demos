Temporary development notes here
--------------------------------

 - besides thread safety, other things I want to do:
     * speed up ZZX mul: faster HomMul and faster SSMul
     * speed up GF2X mul using new x86 instructions

-----------------------------
These are basically notes to myself on preparing a new
distribution of NTL.
-----------------------------


- change version numbers in ../include/NTL/version.h, DIRNAME, and WINDIR

- change the libtool soname in VERSION_INFO. See:

http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html

- if changes were made to makefile or ../include/NTL/config.h, 
  make sure these changes are implemented in the template files 
  mfile and cfile, and then run:

./configure
cp makefile def_makefile
cp ../include/NTL/config.h ../include/NTL/def_config.h

- update ../README and ../doc/copying.txt

- run:  

make ppdoc
make package
make winpack

NOTE: try executing export COPYFILE_DISABLE=1
beforehand
